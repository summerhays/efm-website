## [About Quakers](/intro)

Quakers are a community of seekers with diverse beliefs. We seek meaningful life, an accepting community, and doing good in the world. 

Quakers cherish humanity, perceiving an Inner Light or “that of God” in every human being. Love is the source of [Quaker values](/testimonies) and our peace-building work.

We are an active and affirming community &nbsp;[![Rainbow flag](/assets/images/Rainbow-Flag.jpg){: height="22" class="down_a_tad"}](/intro) &nbsp;All are welcome.

<br>
## [Quaker practice](/about)
The centre of the Quaker meeting is our quiet [meeting for worship](/about). We sit and seek a stillness together, without any special leaders. Hard to describe, we enter into a kind of communion with each other, the world, and with the divine presence. Sometimes out of this silent unity comes a message — someone may speak, read, pray or even sing.

We are Quakers of all kinds — Christian Quakers, nontheist Quakers, Buddhist Quakers, and more — gathered in a circle around our 400-year old practice and our common quest to better [live love](/intro).

## Children’s Programs
Children and youth attending the Meeting are an integral and valuable part of the community. The Meeting provides warm, engaging childcare to infants and children younger than school-age.

School-age children through middle school are invited to be a part of the Meeting’s worship (upstairs in the Meeting room) for the first fifteen minutes (10:00 to 10:15) and then attend religious education classes (during the school year).  Optionally, during that first fifteen minutes prior to the start of classes, children and family members are invited to participate in the worship service downstairs in Friendship Hall .  Our nursery staff is available to worship with your child/grandchild of any age.  Classes then start at 10:15 and end at 11:30.

High school age children transition into adult roles in the community. As a community, we seek to nurture the spiritual lives of our children and prepare them for responsible, informed, and loving participation in the life of the Meeting, in their families, and in their communities.  High school age children are always welcome to attend and participate in the Middle School classes.
